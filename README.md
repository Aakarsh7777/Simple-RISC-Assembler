# Simple-RISC-Assembler

This project is a simple assembler for a Tiny RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, developed in Python. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the `tkinter` module to make assembling programs more user-friendly.

## âœ¨ Features

- Assemble RISC assembly code into machine code
- Syntax error detection with user-friendly messages
- Graphical interface using `tkinter`
- Load and save assembly files easily
- View and save the generated machine code

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher  
- `tkinter` module (typically included with Python)

> ðŸ’¡ On Linux, if `tkinter` is not installed by default:
> - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
> - **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
> - **Arch Linux**: `sudo pacman -S tk`

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aakarsh7777/Simple-RISC-Assembler.git
   cd Simple-RISC-Assembler
